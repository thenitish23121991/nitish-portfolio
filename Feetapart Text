Testing Session Results - 

(1) It took users approximately 11 more seconds to get to the store itself from the home screen. We observed users go to different tabs on the home navigation before being able to get to the store. 

(2) On the store screen, users saw an average of 21 products before checking a product out. For our competitors, it was an average of 7 products.

(3) The users with very few feetcoins in their balance, they kept saying phrases like "I am not sure if I can redeem a product yet." "I dont have enough coins balance.".





Key Metrics to improve - 

(1) Drop off rate from home screen - More people should visit the store. 
(2) Drop off rate from the store - More people should check out a product. 
(3) Users with less than 100 Feetcoins - Better product redemption rate. 
(4) Better product redemption rate in general. 
(5) Reduce time on task for visiting a product from the store. 




We decided to AB test 2 versions - 



(1) Improved activity across a week in general for Option A.
(2) Less drop off rate from the store. 
(3) Better product redemption rate.
